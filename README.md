Finding Patterns and Trends in E-Commerce Transactions
A large e-commerce platform is facing challenges in understanding their sales performance year over year. Although transactions continue to flow, the business team feels the need to evaluate whether their marketing strategies and offerings have been effective in increasing revenue. Some of the main issues they face include:

1. Uncertainty in Sales Trends The business team does not yet know when peak transactions occurred throughout 2021. Without this information, they find it difficult to determine more effective promotional strategies for upcoming periods. Therefore, it is important to know the month with the largest total transaction value (after_discount) in 2021 to understand when the highest demand occurs.
2. Unclear Most Profitable Product Categories Entering 2022, the product and marketing teams want to know which product categories contribute the most to the total transaction value. With this information, they can focus on optimizing categories with the best performance. Therefore, analysis is needed to identify the category with the largest transaction value in 2022.
3. Changes in Product Category Performance from 2021 to 2022 One of management's main concerns is whether any product categories experienced a decline in transactions from 2021 to 2022. If there are categories experiencing significant declines, they must immediately find the cause and take steps to address it. Thus, a comparison of transaction values from each category in 2021 and 2022 is needed to identify categories that experienced increases or decreases.
4. Payment Method Optimization A convenient payment experience can increase customer satisfaction and reduce order cancellation rates. However, without data on the most frequently used payment methods, the finance and technical teams find it difficult to determine which methods should be prioritized or improved. Therefore, they need to know the top 5 most popular payment methods during 2022 based on total unique orders.
5. Competition Between Major Brands The market analysis team is also observing competition between two major brands, Samsung and Apple. They want to understand how each brand performs in terms of transaction value, so they can determine better marketing strategies. Therefore, it is necessary to rank both brands based on their transaction values to know which one is superior.
